# [EPIC] Contract Analysis Tool - "The Golden Grid"

**GitHub Issue**: [To be created]
**Status**: New
**Priority**: High
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks

## Overview

This epic focuses on implementing the Contract Analysis Tool (internally referred to as "The Golden Grid"), an AI-powered system for extracting and managing critical healthcare contract data. This tool will automate the extraction of key contractual terms from payer contracts, providing healthcare organizations with instant access to crucial business information.

## Business Value

Healthcare organizations spend countless hours manually reviewing contracts to find critical information. The Golden Grid will:
- Reduce contract review time by 80%
- Eliminate manual data entry errors
- Provide instant access to critical contract terms
- Enable proactive management of filing deadlines and requirements
- Improve revenue cycle management through better contract compliance

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Database schema design for contract data
- Document upload and storage infrastructure
- Basic UI for contract management
- User authentication and authorization

### Phase 2: Core Extraction (Week 3-4)
- GPT-4 integration for data extraction
- Extraction templates for common contract types
- Basic validation rules
- Manual review interface

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
- Deadline tracking and notifications
- Fee schedule analysis tools
- Comparison and reporting features
- Bulk processing capabilities

### Phase 4: Integration & Optimization (Week 7-8)
- API development for external integrations

## Success Criteria

### Performance Metrics
- Extraction accuracy > 95% for key data points
- Processing time < 5 minutes per contract
- System uptime > 99.9%
- User task completion time reduced by 75%

### Business Metrics
- 80% reduction in manual contract review time
- 100% deadline compliance tracking
- 50% reduction in revenue leakage from contract terms
- 90% user satisfaction score

## Compliance & Security

### Healthcare Compliance
- HIPAA compliant data handling
- BAA agreements for all third-party services
- Audit logging for all data access
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Security Requirements
